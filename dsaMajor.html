The ability to translate data into meaningful knowledge is an in-demand skill across an ever-widening spectrum of sectors and industries.&nbsp; The Data Science & Analytics program gives students the breadth and depth of theoretical knowledge and practical skills to generate actionable insights and facilitate critical and timely decision-making in a Big Data environment.&nbsp; Students will learn to articulate and answer empirical questions relevant to bodies of data by developing the skills necessary to: interface with structured and unstructured data; identify and implement appropriate methods to extract, analyze, and visualize relevant information from data; and develop and implement predictive models to simulate and analyze complex phenomena.&nbsp; The Data Science and Analytics major provides students with the expertise necessary to pursue a wide variety of careers in the field.&nbsp; Students interested in Data Science & Analytics are encouraged to speak with program faculty at the earliest opportunity.</p>
