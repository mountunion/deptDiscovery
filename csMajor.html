The Computer Science Major emphasizes scientific and technical aspects of computing. A background and 
interest in mathematics is very helpful.&nbsp; In addition to introductory programming courses, students 
may study computer hardware organization, operating systems, systems programming, data 
communication, theory of computation, and principles of programming languages.&nbsp; Major requirements include 
courses in mathematics and a multi-person team software development project; off-campus internships are 
strongly recommended.&nbsp; Computer science is often combined with a major or minor in mathematics, but is
worthwhile with virtually any other discipline.&nbsp; Career directions include systems programming, technical 
support, and research.&nbsp; Graduates are employed by computer hardware and software vendors, 
large and medium-sized companies, and colleges and universities.
