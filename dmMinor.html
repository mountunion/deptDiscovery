The required coursework for the Database Management Minor elevates students from a foundational level to 
advanced knowledge of database systems and the database development process.&nbsp; Students learn the basics
of data modeling and database access languages, along with the skills needed to effectively capture requirements,
compose data models that accurately reflect those requirements, and communicate with databases from a 
web-hosted interface.&nbsp; This minor
gives students a skillset that is valuable for anyone who will be involved in collection, analysis, 
and management of data in 
all areas, from business, to education, to psychology, to the physical sciences....
