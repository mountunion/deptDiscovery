The demand for software developers increases every day, and especially so for people who know how to design 
software for different devices -- smart phones, tablets and computers.&nbsp;  From programming and database 
theory to web development, the Multi-Platform Software Development major will immerse you in the technological 
skills required for success in this growing field.&nbsp; Course requirements include 
a multi-person team software development project, and we strongly recommend that students participate in
off-campus internship experiences.&nbsp; When combined with our strong liberal arts 
foundation, you will not only be technically prepared for your career, you also will be equipped with 
the effective communication and leadership skills valued in today's professional world.
